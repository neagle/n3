There are a number of different versions of this recipe floating around, but this is the one I tried first. I need to give [Peter Suderman's preferred version](https://cocktailswithsuderman.substack.com/p/happy-hour-2-ways-to-make-a-captains) a shot sometime, as he argues that the core requirement of this cocktail is the use of falernum. I love falernum and am loath to question my betters, but I'm a big fan of the version listed above from Robert Hess.

A daiquiri is one of those rare things in life describable as perfect. But for all that, there's an unstable equilibrium to it for this drinker, at least, as it really wants to tip over into a version of itself that uses aged rum instead of light rum. (Not that light rum can't be aged... I'm not going to get into that right now.)

This version of Captain's Blood swaps in an aged rum, preferably Jamaican, and adds two dashes of Angostura. (And adjusts the proportions a little bit.) And, for me, becomes a little more than perfect: it becomes a drink I fall in love with. It's a great way to feature Jamaican rum ([Doctor Bird](https://shop.twojames.com/two-james-doctor-bird-rum.html) is a favorite of mine for this cocktail) and a showpiece for the power of Angostura.

I'm a little unclear on the origin of the name, but there is a movie with the similar-sounding name of [Captain Blood](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026174/), starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, that may or may not have anything to do with this. If you decide you want to be a real fan of this cocktail and watch it, though, your time will be very well spent.
