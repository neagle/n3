I fell a victim to your image first
and called it love because I could not flee.
I, willing, took your water for my thirst,
in part, because it seemed you needed me.
Then broke desire to me with whispered voice:
"My bonds are easy now, with little pain,
but take me now and bind me with your choice,
for I turn cruel, if master I remain."
I fear the dusty handshakes of my age,
yet know the dark inconstancy of now.
Then let us dare to blazon our own page
and stake our very souls upon a vow.
    For love consists of courage and of art,
    and time does not forgive the faint of heart.
