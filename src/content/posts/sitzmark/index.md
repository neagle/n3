Sitzmark

My grandfather built an A-frame cabin
halfway up a mountain with his wife
and his children. He called it "Eagle's Sitzmark",
which refers to the mark left in the snow
between two parallel ski tracks
where a skier has sat down -- the cabin itself
was a matter-of-fact mark in the snow
amidst a busy, new ski resort's chairlifts
and ski runs where my father's family
stopped and caught their breath. (My grandfather
skied until a year or two before he died.)

There was an electric heater
in the bathroom that I remember vividly
though I was always there in the summer
when chairlift chairs swung in place above
slalom runs now covered in clover and
Indian paintbrush. (I remember this particularly
from the day we scattered his ashes there, Grandma
and us.) How vividly I imagined my father's
childhood winters, sitting on cold, cold porcelain
with that heater buzzing angrily glowing red heat
onto his right kneecap. Strap on skis
ski from the porch to the lift and ski
to a paintbrush-red-cheeked blaze.

What must my father have felt bringing his brood
of Nebraska flat fields children and his son
who could devour his stacks of Archie comics
and blue-backed Hardy Boys books tucked in
corners of that cabin, but could hardly dream
the wind and cold and speed of those winters
in the wooden A-framed sitzmark
he and his sisters and brother and mother and
father built amidst the white Montana snow?

It was something of a big deal for my grandmother
when the ski resort decided it didn't want
private cabins in the middle of its runs, anymore,
and reneged on the gentleman's agreement with
the family of the man who engineered their
parking lot. But for me, of course, it wasn't
the same.

From us our children spring
arms wide and empty.
