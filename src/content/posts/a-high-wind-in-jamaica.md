    - 1 tsp crème de banane
    - 1 dash tiki bitters

## Notes

I don't spend a lot of my time inventing new cocktails: I like the classics, and appreciate how hard it is to contribute meaningfully to the existing canon. But I've come back over and over again to this riff on a rum old fashioned that I created to bring together two of my favorite things: Jamaica's national rum, Wray & Nephew White Overproof, and crème de banane.

We are currently blessed with two tremendous versions of the latter: [Banane du Brésil](https://www.giffard.com/en/liqueurs-premium/373-3037.html) and Tempus Fugit's [Crème de Banane](https://www.tempusfugitspirits.com/copy-of-creme-de-cacao). They're different and each is worth having. That means we need more cocktails that use them, so I pulled a basic [Mr. Potato Head](https://www.tastingtable.com/1101587/what-it-means-to-mr-potato-head-a-cocktail/) and swapped in the crème de banane for simple syrup, and then tiki bitters for angostura.

It would be in the spirit of things to use other interesting Jamaican overproofs, including aged ones. A non-Jamaican rum would be another drink entirely.

It's named after [the 1929 novel by Richard Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_High_Wind_in_Jamaica_(novel)), which is one of the most electrifyingly disturbing books I've ever read. I can't recommend it highly enough.
