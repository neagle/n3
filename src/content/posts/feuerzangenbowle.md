This is a video from the first time I tried making a feuerzangenbowle.

The song playing is Manheim Steamroller's [God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKc_6ZqxrY), which has become our official song for lighting a feuerzangenbowle.

# Directions

Get a large (3 or 4-quart) pot (I used a dutch oven) and heat the wine, citrus slices, lemon peel studded with the gloves, nutmeg, and the cinnamon to a simmer over low heat. The principle here, I think, is to give the wine a chance to be infused by the various ingredients you've put inside it. I've definitely cut corners a number of times, here, and heated the wine more quickly, so you can _do_ it, but you're compromising how much of the spice you get in the finished product.

Once you've mulled the wine as much as you want and it's nice and hot, place it wherever you're going to do the presentation. David Wondrich recommends putting it on a trivet over a sheet pan full of water for safety reasons, and I definitely did that the first couple times I tried it, but I've since relaxed. I've found that many people I talk to are more concerned about fire safety than I am. It's true that you're going to be creating a billowing bowl of flame. Take the precautions you feel are warranted. I do keep a pitcher full of water close at hand.

Lay a pair of fireplace tongs over the top. You don't have fireplace tongs? Yeah, I didn't either. I used two long, metal ladles crossed at an angle. Later, I bought a pair of specially made [feuerzangenbowle tongs](https://www.amazon.com/kela-Sugar-Tongs-5-5-Silver/dp/B000JICKRO). You need something metal (neither flammable nor meltable) that doesn't have any channels that will send liquid, molten sugar anywhere it's not supposed to be. You just need some contrivance to suspend the zuckerhut above the pot in a way that keeps it secure while allowing it to slowly drip through.

Soak the zuckerhut thoroughly with the rum, keeping a bunch of it in reserve to keep adding as the zuckerhut burns.

Use a ladle that won't melt or burn. If it's metal, be conscious that heat can potentially travel up the length of the handle it make it too hot to hold. I use a metal ladle that's fine, but it's something to be careful of. Light it on fire, then pour the blazing rum on to the soaked zuckerhut. The zuckerhut, then the whole surface of the wine below, should catch fire.

Now you're running the show: add more rum from time to time as the flames seem to be dying down. At some point, you can add ladles full of wine and pour that on top, too. Be warned: the flames from the wine are yellow and beautiful, but less hot than the rum flames and won't melt the sugar as quickly. I think there's a real push and pull to how frequently you add rum/wine to the zuckerhut, and letting it burn more without interference will result in sugar dripping into the wine that's more caramalized. But you can experiment with the fire show and see how it changes things .on your own. If you come to any theories, let me know.

# Notes

For the rum, Smith & Cross is delicious, sufficiently high proof to burn well, inexpensive, and readily available. I tried splitting it with Batavia Arrack, which was an option listed in Wondrich's original recipe, and I found negligible taste alteration and a decrease in flammibility.

I've tried a few different red wines -- Trader Joe's Grower's Reserve merlot seems to do the job just fine. I haven't really noticed much difference when I've tried slightly more expensive wines.

I decreased the called-for lemons from two to one, as the original recipe was a little tart for my taste.

Zuckerhuts are the hardest thing to procure in this recipe: we've got [a German store](https://www.germangourmet.com/about-us/) near us that's an absolute delight to shop at before Christmas, but you can also order them online, though you'll pay a fair shipping & handling fee. The logical solution at that point is: buy a whole bunch of them.
