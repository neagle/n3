This is a video from the first time I tried making a feuerzangenbowle.

The song playing is Manheim Steamroller's [God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKc_6ZqxrY), which has become our official song for lighting a feuerzangenbowle.

# Directions

TODO: All the directions are direct from David Wondrich. Adapt these based on my experience.

Over a low flame, bring the wine, the citrus slices, the lemon peel (which has been studded with the cloves) and the cinnamon to a simmer in a 3- or 4-quart steel or enameled iron pot.

Remove pot from the burner and put it on a trivet resting on a large sheet pan full of water (safety first!).

Lay a pair of fireplace tongs over the top. (Do not use kitchen tongs, as most have hollow legs that will lead a stream of flaming, molten sugar past the edge of the pot and drip it all over the place; ask me how I know.)

Put the sugar loaf on it and soak it thoroughly with the rum, reserving some to light it with (and, if you wish, some to play with).

Fill a wooden-handled metal Punch ladle with rum, light it on fire and use it to touch off the sugar loaf. Stir and ladle as above.

Please have at least one large fire extinguisher close at hand and proceed with great caution. Choose an appropriate venue, weâ€™re talking about flaming punch after all.  

# Notes

For the rum, Smith & Cross is delicious, sufficiently high proof to burn well, inexpensive, and readily available. I tried splitting it with Batavia Arrack, which was an option listed in Wondrich's original recipe, and I found negligible taste alteration and a decrease in flammibility.

I've tried a few different red wines -- Trader Joe's Grower's Reserve merlot seems to do the job just fine. I haven't really noticed much difference when I've tried slightly more expensive wines.

I decreased the called-for lemons from two to one, as the original recipe was a little tart for my taste.
