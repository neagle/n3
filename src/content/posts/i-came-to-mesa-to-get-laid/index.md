"A prominent law firm in the Southwest suffers a crisis of conscience when caught between the demands of a huge industrial client and a pro bono environmental group. The firm's idealistic leader, Bennett Traube, struggles to keep his colleagues on track while negotiating firm politics, career choices and the appeals of a provocative, driven environmental attorney. Based on a true story, this gripping drama takes a cinematic journey into boardrooms, barrooms, National Parks, corporate offices, hotel rooms and a mansion copied from a Scottish castle. It paints a vivid and unusual portrait of lawyers trying to make ethical choices under enormous pressure."

Max (thirties to forties)

Max is a partner in a law firm. He’s talking to some other lawyers in
the firm about how he came to work there.

MAX: I came to Mesa to get laid, d’I ever tell you? True story, and not a word of this to Maia, cause we were already engaged. I had this job interview in Frisco, and an old girlfriend from law school calls, “Hey, Maxie, drive through Mesa on your way west, and we’ll get it on.”

So we’re in bed getting biological, and she starts in about this place where she’s a summer associate; D&R, some little weird-ass firm that pays you for pro bono work, up to 20 percent of billable hours, and it’s in the fuckin’ bylaws, Rule 7 it’s called, and I’m going “This chick is stoned, what’s she talking about, legal aid or something” — she’s grabbing my hand, putting it places but I’m getting curious about this firm of hers, like “Who pays for these free hours?” and she’s going “Harder Max, faster,” but I’m very interested now, like “How does it work, the rainmakers subsidize the freebies, and they’re okay with this?” She’s making these moany-gurgling noises but now I’m going nuts trying to work it out; I mean, are these guys for-real grown-up attorneys, or are we talking Larry-the-Lawyer wanna-bees who passed their bar exam after five tries? So next morning I swing by the place to check it out, and hallelujah! Everything she said was true. It was legal paradise, man. I applied on the spot.
