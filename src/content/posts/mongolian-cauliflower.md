  title: "Mongolian Cauliflower"
  ingredients:
  - 1 head cauliflower, about 1 1/4 pounds
  - 2 small bunches of scallions
  - 2 teaspoons black mustard seeds
  - 2 teaspoons cumin seeds

  - 1/2 teaspoon turmeric

  - 1/4 cup olive oil
  - 1/3 cup chopped fresh coriander or 8 fresh curry leaves

## Directions

Separate and cut the cauliflower into 1-inch florets. Peel the cauliflower stem and cut into thin slices. Set aside. Trim the scallions and chop them, including the entire green part. Set aside. Measure out the spices and place them, as well as the water, right next to the stove.

Heat the oil in a wok or a sauté pan over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the mustard, cumin, and fennel. When the seeds stop sputtering, add the turmeric and immediately add the cauliflower.

Stir fry the cauliflower until it’s evenly coated with spice-infused oil. Add the scallions and water; mix and cover with a lid. Cook over medium heat and toss a couple times until the cauliflower is soft, about 10 minutes.

Uncover, fold in the coriander, and continue stir-frying until excess moisture evaporates and the cauliflower looks glazed, about 5 minutes.

## Notes

I made this a number of times when I was younger: it's my favorite way to have cauliflower. It comes from a paleo recipes site that I can no longer find.
