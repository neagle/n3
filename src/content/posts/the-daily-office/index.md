The brown-burnt taste of roast coffee
lingers on my tongue like the sharp spice
of woodsmoke from a wooded cottage,
the ghost of boiled water and warmed kitchen
and sizzled bacon lending pleasure and verve
to swinging axe or driving plough -- work!
toil transformed by fire, by the offering of
leaf limb trunk, bud pit bean
burnt to god Desire: a prayer to want our lot.
How abundantly answered! How daily
it is given to us to want to live--
how miraculously, how joyfully.
The things we burn are holy
rams placed in thickets--Abraham!
Take your hand from Isaac:
God himself has provided
the sacrifice.
