The emptiness of twenty sears my eyes:
I may not see myself as I but seem,
for day on day shall rend my fair disguise.
I am not young, nor do I aught but dream.
 
And shall I gorge with bloated need
to find at last such meat to be
a ruinous and fitting feed
for hunger's harsh maturity?

Then old am I today,
no stolen joys I take.
So dawn sinks down to day:
Tomorrow I shall wake.
