In a child's bedroom in a yellow house
on a brown hill my mother sang to me.
"Good night, my father--" One night
I interrupted. "But Dad is on his trip!"
The song wasn't about my dad;
it was my Heavenly Father, it turned out,
who was supposed to put the angels all around my bed.
I liked the song better before.
My mother's voice, my father in the next room,
putting my sister to bed,
their presences the whole cosmos
that I wanted, or needed.

In an orange-lit room by a street
with the insect chirping of a garbage truck
somewhere nearby
my son asks me to sing him three lullabies again.
This is new, for him; most nights his mother is home
and he always asks for her to sit with him.
I am not prepared
for the flood of ancient joy
at having my child want my voice.
I try to sing him the long echoes
of a thousand thousand fathers and mothers
who have loved their children in dark rooms
in quiet spaces in unaccompanied songs that rise
like fitful sparks from a red and cracking log
to a black, fathomless sky.

I do not believe in the Heavenly Father.
But I have loved my own father.
And my mother,
whose voice was with me in her womb.
I grew too fast for all of us
and soon read myself to sleep
and wanted no songs.

My son--I cannot promise to weather your separation
with much greater grace than did they.
But perhaps there will be a night someday
by a small bed where you watch a small hand
And sing--

--and think of me, tonight,
and what I must have felt, singing, about you.

--Nathanael Eagle
