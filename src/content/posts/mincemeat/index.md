  title: Mincemeat
  ingredients:
  - 100g salted butter, melted
  - 250g sultanas or a mix of sultanas, raisins, and dried cranberries
  - 100g dried apricots
  - 1 medium apple, such as Gala or Fuji, peeled and grated
  - 175g brown sugar
  - 50g chopped toasted almonds (toast in a dry pan under constant supervision)
  - 50g chopped toasted walnuts
  - 1/2 tsp ground allspice
  - 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
  - 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
  - 2 tbsp brandy
  - 2 tbsp golden rum
  - Zest and juice of 1 orange
  - Zest and juice of 1 lemon
  directions:
    Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive bowl and leave covered, at room
    temperature, overnight. Store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks before
    use. This makes enough for one large two-crust pie, two tarts or about six of
    those old-fashioned pattypan tins.

## Notes

I got this recipe from a former coworker named Jeannelle. It's pretty different from the jarred mincemeat I grew up with. But I found that it's quite delicious in its own way: the nuts and apricots give it a different texture and flavor. I think it's a little more popular with folks who aren't already into mincemeat than the standard recipe.

The most important note I'd give is to really chop up the dried apricots finely: having big chunks of them in the mincemeat isn't ideal.

I can never find sultanas: I just use golden raisins instead.

I also have a probably irrational aversion to calling it "mince" instead of "mincemeat," but I don't think I really have any ground to stand on.
