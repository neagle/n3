If you want to be in musicals, you've got to have some audition songs.

# Ready to Go

* [Mister Cellophane, Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfNIYUvPrsM&pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD)

Suggested by my voice teacher and friend, Meghan Williams Elkins. I performed it at her spring recital in May 2025. Great for my range, has a high G at the end that takes work. Used it to audition for the 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee in June 2025. I need to prepare a printed version that's a 32-bar cut, spliced together so it doesn't require the pianist to perform any jumps.

* [Grow for Me, Little Shop of Horrors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgVnpMkXOas&pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD)

Recorded a video audition for Little Shop of Horrors at Compass Rose Theatre, didn't advance further. (They requested songs from the production.) I like the song, though.

# In the Works

* [Purpose, Avenue Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5glOLjR7VK4)

I've never actually _seen_ Avenue Q, but I love this song. Has a style (lots of glissandos) that's harder for me, so it's good practice. Unsure if this will end up as a good audition piece.

# Possibilities

* [If I Can't Love Her, Beauty & the Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMXR_4_gX84)
* [Happy-Sad, the Addams Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Y3TYGoXAs)
* [Fight the Dragons, Big Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TNpMmJw54w)
* [Fantasies Come True, Avenue Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HOJ6JgaE0)
* [Something from Chaplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplin_(2006_musical))
* [Lost in the Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_the_Stars) ([Madeline Kahn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dwMl0wzBEI))
* [Bring Him Home, Les Miserables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsYnhVITf9E)

Suggested by Meghan.
