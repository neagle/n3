Tom Sawyer attended his own funeral:
his only funeral, in fact, possessed as he was
of neither bones nor flesh.
My uncle had no funeral at all,
advantaged though he was in substance.
Tom Sawyer lived long enough to
appear in a sequel about his friend,
a sequel much better received in
classrooms across the country,
and to be an absolute prick
in the last part of that book
that I usually, mercifully forget.
My uncle, not by blood,
could be a bit of an asshole,
and thought my liberal artsy
college degree was frankly stupid.
We argued, once, about whether
different debit/credit cards cost
merchants different amounts and
to his credit
he emailed me afterward and told me
I'd been right.
I guess it's probably not his decision
but I still consider it
a final act of rudeness
to die without a funeral.
You weren't a sentimental guy, I get it
but you were still my fucking uncle.
Still would've meant something to me.
